  <p class="center"> Welcome viewer, to my very first webpage! I am a student currently enrolled
    at UIC and pursuing a major in IDEAS. Here is a collection of my
    projects over the course of this semester in my IDEA 120 class,
    as well as a few of my past artworks from various classes as well as art I make in my spare
    time. <a href= "https://twitter.com/DylanDraws1/media">Follow my Twitter here!
    </a>
I post various art on my Twitter from time to time.

   <h2 class="center"> Digital Header </h2>
  <img src="artdeco1.jpg" height="690" class="center">
  <p class="center"> I wasn't sure what I was going to do for this project at first. I fiddled
    around with thhe idea of doing a collage of my pictures from photography,
    but couldn't quite get the formatting right.
    I knew I liked the art deco style, so I decided to run with it
    and make a trippy header for my name.</p>

   <p class="center"> For this project we were supposed to revamp our previous project, as seen
     above. We were given free range to redesign it if we wanted to, which I did;
     but the big focus here was making vector outlines in adobe photoshop. This gives
     you the power to tweak shapes and give them all kind of fun edges and curves.
     I decided to change a lot of the components in my design because I felt it was too
     busy. </p>

  <h4 class="center"> Twine game </h4>

  <p class="center"> This is the twine game I created. This was the most enjoyable project that
    I made. Twine wasn't something I was well versed in. I've heard of it and even
    played a few games, but I never thought to make one, or that I'd be capable of
    making one in the first place. I enjoyed the story making, but I quickly found
    myself writing a story that would ultimately end up being a very long game.
    I switched the direction and pace of the story at the end and was happy with <head>
      result.
